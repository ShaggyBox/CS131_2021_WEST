# Info
My understanding of this project is to study a specific intrest related to this course, apply that priciple to solve a problem, then present. We can use this page to upload our work. In order to keep things organized I would suggest creating your own folder for a specific topic and working with others in that directory(folder) if you want to work on that topic. I invite anyone who has worked with github before to assist if you know best practices when it comes to colaboration.
